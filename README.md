# OpenCameraRig
## Introduction
This is ongoing project to make a motion controlled camera rig. This repo is the Android app forked from [Open Camera](https://sourceforge.net/projects/opencamera/). It is an extension to my other repo [Arduino Camera Rig](https://github.com/Civelier/ArduinoCameraRig). There is a lot more info on there.

## Brief summary
There is an Arduino controlling motors with stepper drivers. In the future I want the main Arduino to control video start, end, focus, zoom, exposure, etc.

## Purpose
This project adds an implementation to Open Camera to allow control of certain features via serial communication to an Arduino. There will most likely be a C++ project in this repo for the Arduino part in the future.

## WIP
This specific project is heavily under construction. The app might work, but it's purpose has not yet been reached.
